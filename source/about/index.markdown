  Hey, I'm Kevin, a web developer for Mozilla, constantly breaking the Firefox
  Marketplace. I am a native to Portland, OR. You'll most often catch me building
  dumb webapps, bricking a basketball, taking B&W pictures of lawn chairs, typing
  letters to make words, and watching my Blazers. I do many stuffs and doesn't
  afraid of anything.
