A large portion of photography consists of what to do with photos *after*
shooting them. In post-processing, I play Bachelorette and go through a process
of **selection**. In a selection workflow, we weed out "bad" photos until all
that are left are keepers.

What's the point of selection? Let's say I take my camera and go out and take
100 photos of something (e.g. of precious cats, of lawn chairs, of my dinner)
and throw them on my laptop.  Now, I could just Ship It and upload all 100
photos for the world to vicariously enjoy. But seriously, people ain't got time
that. To sift through a pile of mostly rubbish to find something worth at least
two seconds of their life. Unless they're my mum, most people would lose
interest after 10 photos.

For those that might care about the quality of what they share, selection
improves the quality of the final result. It's also fun to go through vacation
photos in this manner; it feels as if trips aren't completely over yet despite
me sitting on my laptop at home going through photos.

I define selection into several stages:

- First-pass rejection of images.
- Stacking of similar or duplicate images.
- Selection of the best of similar images.
- Waiting.
- Second-pass rejection of images.
- Selective publishing.

At this point, selection sounds pretty dry, but I'll explain each stage
