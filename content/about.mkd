Hey, I'm Kevin, a web developer at Mozilla. I work on the [Firefox
Marketplace](https://marketplace.firefox.com), the FirefoxOS app store. I'm
from Portland, and there you'll find me building webapps, taking photographs,
playing live tournament poker, shooting basketballs, reading sci-fi novels, or
writing blog posts.
