Hey, I'm Kevin, a web developer for Mozilla, constantly breaking the [Firefox
Marketplace](https://marketplace.firefox.com). I am a native to Portland, OR.
You'll most often catch me building throwaway webapps, donking at the local
poker club, bricking a basketball, taking B&W pictures of lawn chairs, typing
on my keyboard to make words, and watching my Blazers.
