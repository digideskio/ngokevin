Hey, I'm Kevin, a web developer for Mozilla, constantly breaking the [Firefox
Marketplace](https://marketplace.firefox.com). I am a native to Portland, OR.
You'll most often catch me building throwaway webapps, donking at the hometown
poker club, bricking basketballs, taking B&W pictures of lawn chairs,
polymerizing letters to summon words, or watching my Blazers.
