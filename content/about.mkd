Hey, I'm Kevin, a web developer for Mozilla, constantly breaking the [Firefox
Marketplace](https://marketplace.firefox.com). I am a native to Portland, OR.
You'll most often catch me building dumb webapps, bricking a basketball, taking
B&W pictures of lawn chairs, typing letters to make words, and watching my
Blazers. I do many stuffs and doesn't afraid of anything.
