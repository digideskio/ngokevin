Hey, I'm Kevin, a web developer for Mozilla, continual breaker the [Firefox
Marketplace](https://marketplace.firefox.com), and from Portland.  You'll most
often catch me building disposable webapps, donking at the local poker club,
bricking basketballs, snapping B&W pictures of lawn chairs, or writing stuff.
