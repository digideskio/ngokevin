My name is Kevin Ngo, an undergraduate **computer science** student at Oregon
State University, born and raised in Portland. I currently work at the OSU
Network Engineering Team [NET][net] in Network Services Systems as a programmer
/ web developer / security-analyst / box-breaker. In the past, I have
volunteered at [Free Geek][freegeek], helping build Linux boxes out of recycled
and donated computers to give to non-profit organizations. You can find more
about me at [linkedin][linkedin]

I love **learning** as well as having the ability to build practical
applications that could potentially help others. For these reasons, I enjoy
computer science and **programming**. Because there are so many aspects to both
and because the world of technology is moving extremely fast (careful not to
blink), the learning never ends. I also enjoy learning [piano][piano], playing
[tennis][tennis] and basketball, and zipping around campus on my longboard.

I prefer working in **Linux** (preferably Bebian or Hannah Montana Linux) ,
developing with **Python/Django**, and keeping it all under wraps with **Git**.
Along with that I have worked with Bash, DHTML, PHP, SQL, MongoDB, C/C++, Java,
and SVN. 

Some Projects
###

- [lug.oregonstate.edu][lug]: the Oregon State University Linux Users Group
  website in Wok, check out my blog posts!

- [reggit][reggit]: a home-grown Python API to the OSU class registration
  website (via HTTP requests) along with a full-featured Django frontend. Too
bad it broke when OSU changed their website, they knew they had competition

- [prestobot][prestobot]: a conglomeration of Python and Bash that scrapes the
  front page of various music community pages on Reddit for user-posted YouTube
links, downloads the links, zips and uploads it to Rapidshare, and posts a
download link back to the page for everyone to listen to

- [netshed][netshed]: library of syslog-ng network log parsers to MongoDB with
  Django frontend (written at OSU NET), horray for open-sourcing projects!

- [soundcloud-dl][soundcloud]: a Python soundcloud API, the baby of a small
  hackathon with [uberj][uberj] and [thedjpetersen][thedjpetersen]
