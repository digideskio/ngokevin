Hey I'm Kevin, a web developer at Mozilla. I'm from Portland, currently working
from San Francisco. I love to [code](https://github.com/ngokevin), [play
poker](http://ngokevin/com/blog/tags/poker), and [take
pictures](http://ngokevin.com/photography). Other active hobbies include
basketball and hiking. Among inactive hobbies include tennis, piano, and
longboarding.
