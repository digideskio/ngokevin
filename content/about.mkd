Hey, I'm Kevin, a web developer at Mozilla. I'm from Portland, currently
working in San Francisco. I'm a [webapp builder](https://github.com/ngokevin),
[amateur poker player](http://ngokevin/com/blog/tags/poker), and [hobby
photographer](http://ngokevin.com/photography). On the side, I play tennis,
basketball, and hike tall things.
